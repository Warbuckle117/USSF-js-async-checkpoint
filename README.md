This is Mark and Jordan's submission for SDI6 async checkpoint

This application works by running npm start PokiName.txt where PokiName.txt is a text file with Pokemon names seperated by a new line

If you run index.js without any names. The console will return the error, and a string response.
If you enter a name that is not a pokemon the console will return 'is not a Pokemon' with the pokemon name. In this case it will still go through the other names.
